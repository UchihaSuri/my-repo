No rush
You just take your time
Tell me I’m all right
Take me through your mind
Say I’m tryna f*ck
I think that you’re right
I still feel a thing when I look you in your eyes
Maybe you're my weakness
Or just part of the season
You know I've been speeding
So maybe I just need this
Or maybe I just feel you for no reason (feel you)
Maybe I just feel you for no reason
(Yeah)
